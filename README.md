# Documentation
Full API documentation can be found [here](http://gglol-docs.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/)


# Technology
1. MongoDB - https://cloud.mongodb.com  (Free Tier - Stage)
1. AWS - Lambda (APIs & Schedule Jobs)

# Architecture

## AWS
As noted above 99% of our infra is hosted in AWS for cost savings. 
We use lambdas to run our APIS and scheduled jobs and use SNS and SES to communicate with the users via email and push notifications.
Future thoughts are to use SNS for an event based architecture.
